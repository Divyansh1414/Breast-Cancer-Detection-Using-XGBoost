# Breast-Cancer-Detection-Using-XGBoost
This project uses machine learning to classify breast cancer as malignant or benign. It evaluates multiple models like XGBoost, Random Forest, and SVM, with techniques like SMOTE for class imbalance and SHAP for model interpretability. The best model is selected based on precision, recall, and F1-score.
